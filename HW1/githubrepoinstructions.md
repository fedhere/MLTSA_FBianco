## ASSIGNMENT
- make an account on GitHub if you do not have one yet
- Create a repository called FMLTSA_\<FirstinitialLastname\>

  please observe the capitalization (and remove \< and \>)!


To create the GitHub repository follow the steps below:

- If you do not have one, go to GitHub.com and create an account

  Then create the repo called FDSFE_\<firstinitialLastname\> (for me that is FDSFE_FBianco)
  Go to github.com - now it will look different! - note: the examples say DSPS_FBianco because they were created for another class, use FDSFE instead of DSPS

  Select "Public" for the repository status and "Add a READEME file" and Python for .gitignore template

  When you click "Create Repository" this will take you to your new "repo". There, edit the Readme.md (use the pencil on the left)
